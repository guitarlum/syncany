Do not use it\r\n                 for important files.\r\n\r\nSyncany is an open-source cloud storage and filesharing application. It allows\r\nusers to backup and share certain folders of their workstations using any kind\r\nof storage, e.g. FTP, Amazon S3 or Google Storage.\r\n\r\nWhile the basic idea is similar to Dropbox and JungleDisk, Syncany is\r\nopen-source and additionally provides data encryption and more flexibility in\r\nterms of storage type and provider:\r\n\r\n- **Data encryption**: Syncany encrypts the files locally, so that any online\r\n  storage can be used even for sensitive data.  \r\n- **Any storage**: Syncany uses a plug-in based storage system. It can\r\n  be used with any type of remote storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Directly jump to ...**\r\n\r\n- [Download and install daily snapshots](#download-and-install-daily-snapshots)\r\n- [Sample usage](#sample-usage)\r\n- [Build and test Syncany](#build-and-test-syncany)\r\n- [Documentation, diagrams and screencasts](#documentation-diagrams-and-screencasts)\r\n- [Setup Eclipse IDE for development](#setup-eclipse-ide-for-development)\r\n- [How can I help?](#how-can-i-help)\r\n- [Licensing, website and contact](#licensing-website-and-contact)\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload and install daily snapshots\r\n------------------------------------\r\nWe're building snapshots of the latest master-branch commit as soon as they are committed (older snapshots\r\nare removed). At the moment, the build process outputs a \\*.tar.gz and a \\*.zip archive, as well as\r\nan executable for Windows (\\*.exe installer) and a Debian/Ubuntu package (\\*.deb).\r\n\r\n**To download it, check out the [latest builds](http://syncany.org/dist/)!**  \r\nThe corresponding [JavaDoc](http://syncany.org/docs/javadoc/), the\r\n[JUnit test reports](http://syncany.org/reports/tests/) and \r\nthe [Cobertura coverage reports](http://syncany.org/reports/coverage/) are also available.\r\n\r\n**Please note**: These builds are created from *unstable*, sometimes *erroneous* code. \r\nThings might change very often and newer versions might not support older repositories.\r\nPlease **do NOT** use these builds for important files.\r\n\r\nSample usage\r\n------------\r\n\r\nUsage is pretty similar to a version control system. If you have used Git or\r\nSVN, it should feel a lot alike.\r\n\r\n**1. Initialize a local directory**\r\n\r\n        $ syncany init \r\n        \r\n        Choose a storage plugin. Available plugins are: ftp, local, s3\r\n        Plugin: ftp\r\n        \r\n        Connection details for FTP connection:\r\n        - hostname: myhost.example.com\r\n        - username: myuser1\r\n        - password: somepassword1\r\n        - port (optional):\r\n\r\n        The password is used to encrypt data on the remote storage.\r\n        Please choose it wisely.\r\n\r\n        Password: (secret password)\r\n        Confirm: (repeat it)\r\n        \r\nThis sets up a new repository on the given remote storage and initializes the\r\nlocal folder. You can now use `syncany connect` to connect to this repository\r\nfrom other clients.\r\n\r\n**2. Add files and synchronize**\r\n\r\nTo let Syncany do everything automatically, simple use the `syncany watch` command. \r\nThis command will synchronize your local files. \r\n\r\n        $ syncany watch \r\n\r\nYou can also manually trigger the upload of your local files or the download of remote changes:\r\n\r\n        $ syncany up\r\n        $ syncany down\r\n\r\nFor a detailed demo, please refer to a [screencast](#documentation-diagrams-and-screencasts). \r\n\r\n\r\nBuild and test Syncany\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n**0. Requirements**: Syncany is based on Java 7 and we use Gradle for dependency management\r\nand as build tool. Gradle does all the dependency magic. All you need to build Syncany\r\nis a **JDK 7**. If you like to create a Debian package (optional), you also need\r\n[FPM](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) installed.\r\n\r\nOn a Debian-based system that would be:\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\r\n   \r\nAnd optional for building Debian packages (*debian* task):\r\n\r\n        $ sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev build-essential rubygems\r\n        $ sudo gem install fpm\r\n\r\n**1. Checkout code and build**\r\n\r\n        git clone http://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany\r\n        cd syncany        \r\n        ./gradlew installApp         (on Linux / Mac OS)\r\n        gradlew installApp           (on Windows)\r\n\r\nThis compiles and installs the Syncany command line client to \r\n`syncany-cli/build/install/syncany/bin/syncany`. You can run it from there.\r\n\r\n**2. Install command line client (to run `syncany` from anywhere)**\r\n\r\nTo be able to run `syncany` (or short: `sy`) from anywhere, you can install a \r\nsymbolic link on your system. On Linux, the link is placed in `/usr/local/bin`,\r\non Windows, a batch file is placed in `C:\\Windows`. To do this, run the\r\nfollowing commands:\r\n\r\n*On Linux / Mac OS:*\r\n\r\n        sudo ./gradlew fakeinstall   (on Linux / Mac OS)\r\n        \r\n*On Windows:*\r\n  - Click *Start*, type `cmd`, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. If a warning appears, click *Yes*.\r\n  - In the command box, `cd` to your checkout directory and run `gradlew fakeinstall`\r\n        \r\nPlease note: There is no easy way to permanently install Syncany on your system, \r\nyet. We're working on an installer for Windows, and packages for Linux.\r\n        \r\n**3. Run it!**\r\n\r\n        syncany --help        \r\n \r\n\r\nDocumentation, diagrams and screencasts\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of reading material on Syncany already.

Click \"Finish\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I help?\r\n---------------\r\nIf you'd like to help developing Syncany, there are a few ways to do so.\r\n\r\n1. **TODO markers**: The Java code contains lots of `TODO` markers, classified in *high*,\r\n   *medium* and *low*. Using the *Tasks* tab in Eclipse, pick one or two and start coding. To get\r\n   started, check out the *Setup Eclipse* section above.\r\n\r\n2. **Issues, features and tasks**: Besides the markers in the code, there are lots of other things \r\n   that need doing. There is an always up-to-date list in the \r\n   [issue tracker](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues) with the label\r\n   [status:help-needed](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/issues?labels=status%3Ahelp-needed).\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask.
